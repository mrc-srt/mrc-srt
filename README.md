# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm **Marco Saretta**, an industrial PhD researcher working at the intersection of **energy markets, optimization, and green hydrogen**.



## ðŸ”­ **Current Research**

My PhD project **"Commoditizing Green Hydrogen in Europe: From Efficient Market Design to Optimal Contracting and Investment"**
focuses on developing **quantitative tools** to:  
- **Price Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)** and optimize contracts for green hydrogen.  
- Support **investment and contracting under uncertainty**.

**Key areas**:  
- **Market Design** for hydrogen (TSOs/DSOs, efficient structures).  
- **Contracting & Investment** models to improve bankability of PtX projects.


## ðŸ§  **Technical Stack & Interests**

- **Energy system modelling** :  
  - Main languages: **Python** (primary), **Julia**.  
  - Tools: **Gurobipy, Linopy**, Pyomo, and other optimization libraries.
  - Sector coupling technologies (hydrogen, district heating)  
- **Machine Learning** for energy systems (forecasting, optimization under uncertainty).  
- **Game Theory**: especially applied to PPAs and hydrogen contracting/market mechanisms.  


## ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to Collaborate On**

- **Optimization models** for energy markets and contracting.  
- **Hydrogen market** and PPA pricing models.  
- Anything at the intersection of **energy systems, optimization, and machine learning**.
